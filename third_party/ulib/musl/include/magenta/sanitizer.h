// Interfaces declared in this file are intended for the use of sanitizer
// runtime library implementation code.  Each sanitizer runtime works only
// with the appropriately sanitized build of libc.  These functions should
// never be called when using the unsanitized libc.  But these names are
// always exported so that the libc ABI is uniform across sanitized and
// unsanitized builds (only unsanitized shared library binaries are used at
// link time, including linking the sanitizer runtime shared libraries).

//     [shadow_limit,   memory_limit)   Address space available to the user.
//     [shadow_base,    shadow_limit)   Shadow memory, preallocated.
//     [0,              shadow_base)    Shadow gap, cannot be allocated.

// definitions are seen by libc even if the user code is being compiled
// with -fvisibility=hidden or equivalent.

// This is called at program startup, with the arguments that will be
// passed to main.  This is called before any other application code,
// including both static constructors and initialization of things like
// mxio and mx_get_startup_handle.  It's basically the first thing called
// after libc's most basic internal global initialization is complete and
// the initial thread has switched to its real thread stack.  Since not
// even all of libc's own constructors have run yet, this should not call
// into libc or other library code.
