// Top-of-lower-usable-DRAM quirk.
//
// Intel processors sometimes steal a bit memory for GPU and SMM needs.  When
// they do, the BIOS/bootloader sometimes does not report these regions as
// reserved in the memory map passed to the OS, they just remove them from the
// usable RAM portion of the memory map.  If we fail to remove these regions
// from the set allocatable MMIO regions used by the PCIe bus driver, we can end
// up allocating portions of the bus containing GPU/SMM stolen memory to devices
// to use for BAR windows (this would be Very Bad).
//
// For processors which have a "TOLUD" register (top of lower usable DRAM), we
// can simply subtract out the region [0, TOLUD) from the PCIe bus driver's
// allocatable regions.  This register (on 6th gen Intel Core processors at
// least) lives in the config space for the host bridge device.  Look for it and
// subtract out the region.  If we don't find the register, and cannot be sure
// that the target we are running on does not need this special treatment, log a
// big warning so someone can come and update this code to do the right thing.
